# Hello there!
If you got here, then it must have been linked on one of my pages! If so, let me talk about myself and my dni!

## Disclaimer
I am not and do not claim to be anyone who I don't link in this README.md or my other links unless stated otherwise. This includes other people who have similar profiles or pages to me. With that out of the way, let's begin!

## General Info
I go by many aliases online which you can us, so if you came from my Discord, you either know me as Abel, Brazzy, Jay, or Vatty all names I've used based on profiles pictures!

About age, I can't reveal my exact age, but I can tell you that I am 15+!

About interests, I like reading and essentially have a library in my room, I love writing, so I often writing poems, short stories, and plan out fan fiction stories, and I love singing and often cover songs I enjoy!

For fandoms, I actively participate in the HH, HB, and Warriors fandoms and I semi-actively participate in the Countryhuman and Statehuman fandoms.
